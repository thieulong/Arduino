
If you haven't already, install the ESP8266 Boards addon as per the XC3802
manual located on the product page:

https://jaycar.com.au/p/XC3802

the code in this zipfile is used as an example for our new XC4421 and XC4411
boards.


To write arduino code: 
-------------------------------------
Configure the dip switches as shown: 3,4 are on, the others are off.

|-|-|o|o|-|-|-|-| on
|o|o|-|-|o|o|o|o| off
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|

for XC4421 select Tools->Board->Arduino Mega (for XC4421) Or Uno (for XC4411)

open arduino.ino and press upload.


To write esp code:
-------------------------------------
Configure the dip switches as shown: 5,6,7 are on, the others are off.

|-|-|-|-|o|o|o|-| on
|o|o|o|o|-|-|-|o| off
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|

for XC4421 select Tools->Board->Generic 8266 Module
-> If you cannot see it, you did not read the XC3802 Manual!

open esp.ino and press upload; after compiling, when the IDE says "Uploading.."
You should begin to see ".......________........_____" during this time, press 
the reset button on the MCU; the ESP should begin to accept
instructions.


To run the example:
---------------------------------------
Upload both of the code as above, then configure the switches as shown: (1,2 are on)

|o|o|-|-|-|-|-|-| on
|-|-|o|o|o|o|o|o| off
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|

Open up your wireless internet and you should see a new wireless network.
Connect to it and navigate to http://10.0.0.7, you'll see two hyperlinks
to turn the arduino L13 led on/off. You should be able to see the device
interplay between your phone/computer, the ESP, and the arduino.


Troubleshooting:
-----------------------------------------

"upload esp mem failed" in arduino IDE ESP8266 error:
	* have you selected the right switch config? ensure that 5,6, AND 7, are
	  switched _ON_
	* Did you press the MCU Reset button when the IDE says "uploading" ?

"WiFiServer.h not found" or similar not found messages
	* Did you install the ESP8266 Boards in the Arduino IDE? read the XC3802
	  manual.
	* Have you selected the right board for the project? make sure
	  Tools->Board->Generic8266 board is selected for the ESP project, and
	  Geniuno is selected for Arduino 

Writing html code is better in proper html files, which can be stored in a "data" folder
and uploaded automatically, check out "SPIFFS" for more information:
